        <hr class="my-4">
        <p><b><i> Welcome to my gaming blog! My name is Gautam Kumar Mahar, and I am a computer science engineering student at IIT Goa. I am also an avid esports player, with a particular focus on PUBG. </i><br><br>

          In this blog, we will be exploring the world of esports in India. Over the past few years, esports has seen a tremendous growth in popularity in India, and it is rapidly becoming one of the most exciting and dynamic industries in the country. From amateur players to professional teams, esports is attracting a wide range of participants and fans. <br><br>
          
          One of the main reasons for the growth of esports in India is the increasing penetration of the internet and smartphones. This has made it easier for players to access and play games, as well as connect with other players and compete in online tournaments. In addition, the rise of streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube has also played a major role in popularizing esports in India. <br><br>
          
          Another factor contributing to the growth of esports in India is the increasing interest and investment from companies and organizations. Many companies are now starting to sponsor esports teams and events, which has led to a rise in the number of professional players and teams in the country.<br><br>
          
          The Indian government has also recognized the potential of esports, and is taking steps to promote and support the industry. For example, the government has announced plans to establish a national esports federation, which will work to promote and regulate esports in the country. <br><br>
          
          Despite all the growth and potential of esports in India, there are still challenges that need to be overcome. One of the main challenges is the lack of infrastructure and support for players and teams. Many players and teams in India still struggle to find training facilities, equipment, and other resources.<br><br>
          
          In addition to the growth and potential of esports in India, there are also a variety of different games and genres that are popular among players in the country. Some of the most popular esports titles in India include PUBG, DOTA 2, and CS:GO, as well as mobile games such as Clash of Clans and Clash Royale. <br><br>
          
          There are also a number of esports leagues and tournaments that take place in India, such as the ESL India Premiership and the Indian Gaming League. These events provide players with an opportunity to compete against some of the best players in the country and showcase their skills on a national stage. <br><br>
          
          Furthermore, India is also home to some of the world's best professional players, such as Naman Mathur (MortaL) and Ankit Panth (V3nom), who have made a name for themselves on the global stage. Their success has inspired many young players in the country to pursue a career in esports. <br> <br>
          
          However, as the esports industry in India continues to grow, it is crucial that proper infrastructure and support systems are put in place to ensure that players have the resources they need to succeed. This includes providing training facilities, equipment, and other resources, as well as investing in the development of players and teams.<br><br>
          
          
          In conclusion, esports in India is a rapidly growing industry with a lot of potential. With the increasing internet penetration and interest from companies and government, esports in India is poised to become one of the most exciting and dynamic industries in the country. I, Gautam Kumar Mahar, being a computer science engineering student at IIT Goa and a pubg esports player, will try my best to keep you updated with the latest trends and developments in the esports industry in India through my blogs.
